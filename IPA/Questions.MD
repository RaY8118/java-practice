## üìù **Practice Set for Your Java Exam**

### üî∑ **Problem 1 ‚Äì Mobile Class and Price Calculation**

Create a class `Mobile` with:

* `mobileName` (String)
* `brand` (String)
* `price` (int)
* `is5GEnabled` (boolean)

Write:

1. A method `findAveragePriceByBrand(Mobile[] mobiles, String brand)` to return average price of mobiles from the given brand. If no mobiles with the brand exist, return 0.
2. A method `getMostExpensive5GEnabledMobile(Mobile[] mobiles)` to return the `Mobile` object with highest price among 5G-enabled mobiles. Return null if none found.

### üî∑ **Problem 2 ‚Äì String Vowel Consonant Count**

Write a program that reads a string and:

* Counts number of vowels
* Counts number of consonants

Print both counts. If there are no vowels or no consonants, print an appropriate message.

---

### üî∑ **Problem 3 ‚Äì Book Class with Sorting**

Create a `Book` class with:

* `bookName` (String)
* `author` (String)
* `price` (int)

Write:

1. A method `getBooksSortedByPrice(Book[] books)` that returns an array of books sorted by their price in ascending order.

---

### üî∑ **Problem 4 ‚Äì Palindrome Word Count**

Read a sentence (string). Find and print the number of words in it that are palindromes (same forwards and backwards). If no palindromic words are found, print ‚ÄúNo Palindrome Found‚Äù.

---

### üî∑ **Problem 5 ‚Äì Employee Bonus Calculation**

Create `Employee` class with:

* `empName` (String)
* `salary` (int)
* `yearsOfExperience` (int)

Write:

1. A method `calculateBonus(Employee[] employees)` that increases salary by:

   * 20% if experience > 5 years
   * 10% otherwise

Return an array of updated Employee objects.

### üî∑ **Problem 6 ‚Äì Uppercase Character Count**

Write a program that reads a string and counts number of uppercase characters. If none are found, print ‚ÄúNo uppercase characters present‚Äù.

---

### üî∑ **Problem 7 ‚Äì Car Class: Lowest and Highest Price**

Create `Car` class with:

* `modelName` (String)
* `brand` (String)
* `price` (int)

Write:

1. A method to return the `Car` object with **lowest price**.
2. A method to return the `Car` object with **highest price**.

If no cars exist, return null.

---

### üî∑ **Problem 8 ‚Äì String: Word Length Filter**

Read a string and print words with length greater than 5 characters. If no such words exist, print ‚ÄúNo words with length > 5 found‚Äù.

## ‚úÖ **Recommended Practice Strategy**

* Solve **at least 2-3 per day**.
* Implement full class and methods as in your syllabus.
* Test with **multiple inputs** to strengthen your logic confidence.
* If needed, I can **review your solutions line by line** for corrections and best practices before your exam.
